# Pyrphoros

**Pyrphoros** is a Python library designed to streamline the process of building, configuring, and managing both data pipelines and neural network architectures within the PyTorch framework. Inspired by the mythological figure Prometheus, who brought fire to humanity, Pyrphoros brings the power of dynamic, flexible, and user-friendly graph-based APIs to your machine learning workflows.

## Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: Integrate data preparation and model building into a single, streamlined workflow.
- **Dynamic Pipeline Construction**: Build  data and model pipelines in a coordinated, flexible manner.
- **Graph-Based API**: Customize your machine learning workflows with an intuitive and powerful API.
- **PyTorch-Centric**: Built to work seamlessly within the PyTorch ecosystem, enhancing your existing projects and workflows.

## What Does "Pyrphoros" Mean?

The name **Pyrphoros** (from the Greek "πυρφόρος") translates to "fire-bringer" in English. In Greek mythology, Prometheus is often referred to as Pyrphoros, symbolizing his act of bringing fire to humanity—a gift that enabled progress, knowledge, and civilization.

In the context of this library, Pyrphoros represents the tool that brings the power and flexibility of advanced machine learning workflows to the PyTorch ecosystem. Just as Prometheus's fire was a catalyst for human advancement, Pyrphoros is designed to ignite your machine learning projects, empowering you to create sophisticated models and data pipelines with ease.
